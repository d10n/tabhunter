This extension lets users of Firefox, Flock, and other browsers based on Mozilla easily juggle dozens of tabs at any time.  Enter a search string (actually a standard JavaScript regex), highlight the URL you want to bring up, and press return or double-click it.  Tabhunter will even bring up minimized windows containing the target tab.

Inspired by Davide Ficano's tab selector extension for ActiveState's Komodo IDE, and my own need for some assistance in managing my web-based workload.  Not to be confused by the actor from the '50s and '60s, known by some as 'Tab "Space" Hunter' to avoid any ambiguity.  Despite the header above, the proper spelling of this project is "Tabhunter" with a capital T, lower-case h.
